### <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/158KTqJOaW2VdLXQNLd8pZYCaDVGfSR0e/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Improving Brand Loyalty Through Complementary Product Types</a>

This study was aimed at discovering product types which were the most complementary with each other, or in other words, which product types tended to be bought together the most by consumers. Findings from this study also corroborated existing research that excessive product diversification correlates with decreased brand loyalty. As such, this study proposes diversification into complementary product types in order to maintain brand loyalty. Companies can replicate network analysis methods used in this study to optimise their product offerings and strengthen brand loyalty.

Individuals with higher levels of social anxiety have been found to perceive online communication methods as more effective for self-disclosure. Building on this idea, this study explores whether socially anxious individuals prefer online dating over offline methods. Additionally, it examines how social anxiety, which often leads to a greater fear of negative evaluations and a stronger desire for validation on dating apps, might mediate this preference.

Generative AI (GenAI) has become a valuable tool in education. However, concerns have been raised about its potential negative impact on students’ critical thinking and memory. Past metacognitive research has found that easier access to information often results in reduced effort to memorise it. This study explores whether metacognitive findings made prior to the advent of GenAI hold true in this modern context, by using focus groups to examine students' perceptions and usage of this technology.

Media framing, which refers to how issues are portrayed by the media, affects audiences’ perception of these issues. One effect of media framing is that audiences adopt similar frames in their own conversations, mirroring the way the media presents the topics. This study examines the extent to which this is evident in comments on climate change news articles reposted on Reddit.

The 2023 F1 season was defined by Max Verstappen’s dominance, winning 19 out of 21 races. However, this incredible feat coincided with a drop in viewership across various broadcasting platforms. Many believe that Verstappen’s dominance made the races too predictable, diminishing the excitement and entertainment for fans. This study examines comments on 2023 Race Highlight Videos from the official F1 YouTube channel, comparing them to comments from the 2020 and 2021 seasons to explore this potential impact.
